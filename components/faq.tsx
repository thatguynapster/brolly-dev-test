                As soon as your insurance is concluded, you would receive a digital copy of your documents through your
                email and on whatsapp. You could print them and they are as good as a copy printed from our offices. You
                will also receive an SMS to confirm that you have been entered onto the Motor Insurance Database. <br />
                <br />
                If you require a printed copy from us, we could deliver to you but you will pay the dispatch rider’s
                fee.

                It is advisable to inform us at least 7 days in advance if you are likely to miss your monthly
                installment. We will give you up to 14 days grace period from the due date of your installment to make
                payment. <br />
                <br />
                You will incur a 5% fee on the missed payment when you pay within the 14 days grace period. Beyond the
                14 days, you have a further 14 days extended window within which to settle your payment, failing which
                your insurance would be suspended. Payment made within the second 14 days window attracts a fee of 10%
                of the missed payment. <br />
                <br />
                If we need to suspend your insurance, we would take your name off the Motor Insurance Database.

                We prefer to answer that by asking whether you are satisfied with what you are getting with your current
                insurer. In 95% of the time, people are getting a bad haircut from their current insurer. We are in the
                market for exactly that reason: to redefine insurance service standards in Africa.
