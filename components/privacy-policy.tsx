        </p>
        <p>
          For example, we use cookies to make your browsing experience easier and more intuitive: cookies are small
          strings of text used to store some information that may concern the user, his or her preferences or the device
          they are using to access the internet (such as a computer, tablet, or mobile phone). Cookies are mainly used
          to adapt the operation of the site to your expectations, offering a more personalized browsing experience and
          memorizing the choices you made previously.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cookie consists of a reduced set of data transferred to your browser from a web server and it can only be
